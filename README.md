Coursera Course
- This course project is to do with gathering and cleaning data. The most important job a datascientist is to prepare data that is clean and tidy so that it can be sued for model  building & further analysis. This course explicitly covers plyr, Dplyr, reshape, tidy and other important packages.

- The final project was based on getting and cleaning data, where the data wasdownloaded from link-   https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip later was unzipped and extracted and organised for doing analysis.
